# PDI_PI_IDI
Scripts that make PDI IDI calculations

## Getting Started

These instructions will get let you caculate PI, PDI, and IDI based on a set of genomes/

### Prerequisites

BLASTn

### Installing

You will need to download two scripts create_index.py and run_PDI_total.py. They will have to be in the same folder to work.

## Running the create index

You will need a file that is tab delimited and has genome and file location of spacers.

For example yellowstone2genome file contains:
```
NLOB  spacers.fasta
```
Then, you can specificy the number of mismatches between spacers.
